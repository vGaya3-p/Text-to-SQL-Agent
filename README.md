# Text-to-SQL-Agent
This agent converts natural language queries to SQL queries using LLMs and executes the SQL commands. It also makes sure that the queries are correct syntactically and logically. 
NOTE: This code is database specific. To use this, change the DOMAIN_HINTS_TEXT and the retrieve_context_heuristic function.
